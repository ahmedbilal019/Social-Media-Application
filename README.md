# Social Media Application(Social Post)
This Social media application is named as "**Social Post**" where user can create post and view post.
This project is not fully functional like facebook and twitter as these applications are used for creating and viewing social media post but this project is a basic version where i have learned that **how to navigate between different pages, creating UI using Bootstrap, managing states and creating a new post using React form, getting input data using useRef hook**. 

In this project i get data from React form inputs and then present this data in a attractive UI in the form of Posts. First two posts are hardcoded(written manually in the code), new posts can be removed on refreshing the app because i did not use any database for storing the posts. we can delete post from UI using delete icon. 

Social Post application can be used in different screen devices like mobile, tablets and PCs due to its responsive design.
